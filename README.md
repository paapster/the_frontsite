The FrontSide is a application platform for creating FE applications which can run on the client (browser) and on the server. 

## Getting Started

Install / Get the prerequisites
----------------------------

In order to build / run the FrontSite, you need to have Node.js/npm latest and git 1.8+ or later.
(Earlier versions might work OK, but only the latest version is tested.)

Also make sure that [git](http://git-scm.com/) is installed as some FrontSite
packages require it to be fetched and installed.

First, clone a copy of the main FrontSite git repo by running:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/paapster/the_frontsite.git
```

Install Bower globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g bower
```

Inside the project folder get de bower dependencies

```bash
bower install 
```

Then also in the project folder, install de NPM dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Install the [grunt-cli](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started#installing-the-cli) package if you haven't before. These should be done as global installs:

```bash
npm install -g grunt-cli
```
